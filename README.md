Backend For Lore Log Campaign Manager App

## Lore Log

Lore Log is a campaign management software for tabletop rpgs (primarily D&D) that focuses on building and recording lore. 

The front end can be seen [here](https://github.com/qmulosoft/lorelog-ui). And the deployed app can be seen [here](https://lorelog.app).

### Status

This is very, very early, closed alpha, not really usable by anyone for realz as of yet. If I like it, and it seems useful, I will continue to update it and add features.
